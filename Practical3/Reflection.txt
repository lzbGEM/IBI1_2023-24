During this course, I have learnt version control, how to navigate Unix-like systems and how to write simple programs in Python.

I have also learnt to write careful instructions when communicating online!
I have a lot of challenge because of my computer version but finally, I figured out.
This is a very exciting and interesting thing
I love git
