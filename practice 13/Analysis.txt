Human SC6A4 and mouse SC6A4: alignment score is 3137.0 and identical amino acid percent is 0.9253968253968254
Human SC6A4 and rat SC6A4: alignment score is 3107.0 and identical amino acid percent is 0.9174603174603174
Mouse SC6A4 and rat SC6A4: alignment score is 3261.0 and identical amino acid percent is 0.9682539682539683


Mouse and rat 's sequences are most similar

Human's gene SC6A4 is more like mouse than rat 

Therefore mouse is a better model for studying
variation	in	the	SLC6A4	gene	in	humans
